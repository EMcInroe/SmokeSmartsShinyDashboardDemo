# SmokeSenseShinyDashboard
This repository includes script to create a dashboard to display results from analysis on a survey conducted by the Smoke Sense App. The analysis is ongoing, so the data is not available, only the script that creates the dashboard. ShinyR is used to create a dashboard with 4 pages. The graphs and tables are interactive to allow users to explore the data and draw conclusions.
